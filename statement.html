  ><p class="statement2">I mainly work with digital music production and composition, but I also do some graphic design as well. When I’m making music, I use the computer program Logic Pro X because I know it very well and have been using it since I started producing music 5 years ago. When I’m doing graphic design though, I tend to rely on Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom for any photographs that need editing. I started dabbling with making art in middle school when I would create Youtube backgrounds for my friends on Photoshop and Cinema 4D and from then on I’ve remained a fan of graphic design. My sophomore year of high school, though, is when I began digitally producing music on my laptop. I was inspired by Rap and Hip Hop artists/producers like Kanye West and Earl Sweatshirt who blew my mind with their ability to create sonic landscapes in which their songs, and to a certain extent their personality, lived in.</p

  ><p class="statement2"> I took this Digital Media Art class partly because it was a requirement for my major, but also because of my love for graphic design and desire to learn more about different types of art that fall under the ‘digital’ category. I have always been insecure in a way about my art because of the fact that it is digital. Whether it was the music I would make, or the designs I would produce, it never felt like ‘real’ art because it wasn’t a painting or a sculpture or any other traditional form of art. This class, however, has opened me up to different avenues in the giant subcategory of Digital Media Art, and shown me that digital art in any form is just as valid as any other kind of art.</p
