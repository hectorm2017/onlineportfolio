  ><p class="statement2">The concept for my project was to create a simple game that anyone could play. When I first started using the internet, the way I got introduced was through simple online flash games which I got hooked on. The games were always easy to play and understand, and were never too heavy. Today, I find it hard to find games like these again, in fact the only games that seem to become popular are the complete opposite: heavy on your computer, complicated, and way too long. Choose the Right Colors was a way for me to relive the same excitement I had for these online mini-games, but in the present.</p
